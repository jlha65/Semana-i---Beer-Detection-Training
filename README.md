# Semana-i---Beer-Detection-Training

Here are the images and the model used for https://github.com/jlha65/BeerTensorflow-Android 
Can't push the entire workspace with everything that was needed for the training since it has files over 100MB. If the entire
folder is needed here's a Google Drive link to our entire object_detection folder, which can be replaced over the object_detection
folder in https://github.com/tensorflow/models
